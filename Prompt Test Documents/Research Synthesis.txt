# Simulated UX Research Data Set

## User Interview Transcripts

### Interview 1: E-commerce Checkout - Sarah, 34, Marketing Manager

**Interviewer:** Thanks for joining today. Can you walk me through the last time you made an online purchase?

**Sarah:** Sure. I was buying running shoes last week. I found what I wanted pretty quickly, but then the checkout process was... ugh. They made me create an account before I could even see shipping costs. I almost abandoned it.

**Interviewer:** What specifically frustrated you about creating the account?

**Sarah:** They wanted way too much information upfront. Like, why do you need my phone number and birthday just to buy shoes? And then there were two different password requirements on the same page that contradicted each other. One said 8 characters minimum, another said 10. I failed three times before I figured it out.

**Interviewer:** How did that make you feel?

**Sarah:** Honestly? Like they didn't value my time. I was ready to buy, had my credit card out, and they threw up all these barriers. If I hadn't really wanted those specific shoes, I would've left.

**Interviewer:** Did you complete the purchase?

**Sarah:** Eventually, yes. But I won't shop there again if I can help it.

### Interview 2: Banking App - Marcus, 28, Freelance Designer

**Interviewer:** You mentioned you use your banking app daily. What's your typical use case?

**Marcus:** Mostly checking balances and transferring money between accounts. I get paid irregularly, so I'm always moving money around to make sure bills get paid.

**Interviewer:** Can you show me how you do that?

**Marcus:** [Opens app] Okay, so first I have to get past Face ID, which fails about 30% of the time if I'm outside or wearing sunglasses. Then I'm on the home screen... and honestly, I ignore like 90% of what's here. There's ads for loans I don't want, credit score stuff I check maybe once a month, and these "insights" that are never actually insightful.

**Interviewer:** What would make those insights more useful?

**Marcus:** I don't know, maybe tell me something I don't already know? Like "You spent $200 more on food this month" - yeah, I know, I ordered it. What I'd actually want is like "You have a $450 bill due in 3 days and your checking account is at $380" - that's an insight.

**Interviewer:** So more proactive warnings?

**Marcus:** Exactly. Use the data you have to actually help me, not to show me a pretty chart.

### Interview 3: Healthcare Portal - Linda, 56, Teacher

**Interviewer:** Tell me about your experience using the patient portal.

**Linda:** [Sighs] Where do I start? I've been trying to message my doctor about my prescription refill for two days. The first time I sent a message, it went to the wrong department. The second time, I think it worked, but I have no idea because there's no confirmation.

**Interviewer:** How did you know it went to the wrong department?

**Linda:** I got a generic reply saying "please contact your pharmacy for prescription questions." But my pharmacy said I need the doctor to approve it. It's this endless loop.

**Interviewer:** Is there a phone number you can call?

**Linda:** There is, but the whole point of the portal is supposed to be that I don't have to call during work hours. I'm teaching. I can't just call at 2pm on a Tuesday.

**Interviewer:** What would make this better for you?

**Linda:** Clear categories when I send a message - like explicitly say "prescription refill" so it routes correctly. And let me see the status: received, being reviewed, responded to. Like tracking a package. I just want to know someone got my message.

## Support Tickets

### Ticket #8847 - Mobile App Crash

**User:** App crashes every single time I try to upload a photo. I'm on iPhone 13, iOS 16.5. I've tried deleting and reinstalling. I've restarted my phone. Nothing works. This is incredibly frustrating - I need to upload photos for work and I literally cannot use your app anymore.

**Priority:** High  
**Category:** Mobile - iOS  
**Status:** In Progress

---

### Ticket #9203 - Can't Find Settings

**User:** Where is the setting to turn off email notifications?? I've looked everywhere.

Please just tell me where it is or better yet make it easier to find.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** Account Settings  
**Status:** Awaiting Response

---

### Ticket #9445 - Data Export Failure

**User:** I requested a data export 5 days ago per GDPR requirements. The email said it would take 24-48 hours. I've received nothing. I've requested it 3 more times. I need my data. This is legally required functionality and it's not working.

**Priority:** Urgent  
**Category:** Privacy/Data  
**Status:** Escalated

---

### Ticket #9512 - Confusing Error Message

**User:** I keep getting an error that says "Error 422: Invalid input" but it doesn't tell me WHAT input is invalid. I'm filling out the same form I've filled out 20 times before. What changed? What field is wrong? Give me a real error message please.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** Forms/Validation  
**Status:** Open

---

### Ticket #9688 - Dark Mode Issues

**User:** The dark mode is unusable. Half the text is dark gray on black background - I literally cannot read it. Some buttons disappear entirely. It looks like nobody tested this at all. I have to keep switching back to light mode which defeats the entire purpose.

**Priority:** Medium  
**Category:** UI/Visual  
**Status:** Open

## Survey Open-Ended Responses

**Question: What is your biggest frustration with our product?**

**Response 1:** The search function is terrible. I search for something I KNOW exists and it returns nothing, but if I browse manually I can find it. Why have search at all if it doesn't work?

**Response 2:** Too many clicks to do simple things. I should not need 5 clicks to change my password or 7 clicks to download a receipt.

**Response 3:** Mobile app is years behind the desktop version in features. I do 80% of my work on mobile and feel like a second-class user.

**Response 4:** No keyboard shortcuts. I use this product 8 hours a day and having to click through menus for everything slows me down significantly.

**Response 5:** The tutorial that pops up EVERY TIME I log in. I've been using this for 6 months. I know how it works. Let me dismiss it permanently.

---

**Question: If you could change one thing about our product, what would it be?**

**Response 1:** Better error recovery. When something goes wrong, let me fix it without starting completely over.

**Response 2:** Undo button. Please. I've lost work so many times because there's no way to undo an accidental deletion.

**Response 3:** More customization. Everyone works differently but you force us all into the same rigid workflow.

**Response 4:** Offline mode. My internet isn't always reliable and I lose access to everything when it drops.

**Response 5:** Let me export my data in standard formats. Right now it's locked in your proprietary format and I can't use it anywhere else.

**Response 6:** Stop moving things around with every update. I finally learn where everything is and then you redesign it completely.

---

**Question: What do you like most about our product?**

**Response 1:** When it works, it's fast. I can get through my tasks quickly.

**Response 2:** The collaboration features are solid. Easy to share and work together.

**Response 3:** It's reliable. I've never lost data, which I appreciate.

**Response 4:** Clean interface, not cluttered like competitors.

**Response 5:** Customer support actually responds and helps, which is rare these days.
