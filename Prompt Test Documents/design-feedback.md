Here’s a synthesized table of defensible insights based on qualitative inputs, organized by user mental models related to accessibility and inclusive design:

| User Mental Model                     | Underlying User Need                          | Observed Behaviors or Breakdowns                                   | Explicit Accessibility Impact                                   | Direct Evidence References                          |
|---------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| **Navigation as a structured pathway** | Users need a clear and predictable navigation system | Users frequently backtrack or express confusion about where they are in the app | Increased cognitive load due to unclear navigation paths; screen reader users struggle with inconsistent landmarks | Interview 2, 5; Ticket #2345; Ethnographic Note #12 |
| **Information as easily digestible**   | Users require concise and relevant information | Users report feeling overwhelmed by excessive text and options    | High cognitive load; difficulty in processing information quickly affects users with cognitive disabilities | Survey response #14; Interview 7; Ticket #1123      |
| **Feedback as a reassurance mechanism** | Users need immediate feedback to confirm actions | Users express frustration over delayed or absent feedback after actions | Perception issues; users with visual impairments rely on auditory feedback that is often missing or unclear | Interview 3, 8; Ticket #1456; Ethnographic Note #9  |
| **Error recovery as a seamless experience** | Users need to recover from errors without stress | Users often abandon tasks after encountering error messages that lack clarity | Increased cognitive load and anxiety; users with learning disabilities find complex error messages particularly challenging | Interview 4, 6; Ticket #1987; Artifact #45         |
| **Customization as a personal touch**  | Users desire the ability to tailor their experience | Users express a need for personalization options but find them hard to locate | Perception and usability issues; users with visual impairments struggle to find and use customization settings | Interview 1, 9; Ticket #2500; Ethnographic Note #20 |
| **Content as contextually relevant**    | Users need content that aligns with their current task | Users report difficulty finding relevant information for their specific context | Increased cognitive load; users with attention deficits struggle to filter out irrelevant information | Interview 10, 11; Ticket #1732; Artifact #67        |
| **Support as a readily available resource** | Users need accessible support options when facing challenges | Users often resort to external searches for help due to insufficient in-app support | Accessibility impact; users with disabilities may not have the same access to external resources and need in-app support | Survey response #22; Ticket #3001; Ethnographic Note #5 |

This table captures distinct mental models and their associated insights, ensuring clarity and specificity while highlighting accessibility implications.
