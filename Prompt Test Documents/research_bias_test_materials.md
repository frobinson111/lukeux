### 2. User Interview Transcripts (Selected Excerpts)

#### Interview P01 - Finance Manager, Age 34
**Moderator:** Walk me through your typical expense submission process.

**P01:** "I usually batch everything at the end of the week. I have my receipts in a folder on my desk, and I'll spend about 30 minutes on Friday afternoon just cranking through them. I use the mobile app because it's faster than the desktop—I can just point and shoot the receipts. The OCR works pretty well, maybe 85% accuracy, so I just quickly correct the amounts and categories."

**Moderator:** What's most frustrating about the current process?

**P01:** "Honestly, the biggest pain is when the app crashes mid-submission. I've lost whole batches before. Also, the category dropdown is annoying—I have to scroll through like 40 options every time. I wish it would remember my most-used categories or use some kind of smart suggestion."

---

#### Interview P04 - Marketing Coordinator, Age 27
**Moderator:** Tell me about a recent expense submission experience.

**P04:** "Last week I was at a conference and submitted receipts from my Uber to the venue. The app is super intuitive—I love that I can snap and submit immediately. I don't wait until I'm back at my desk. The interface is clean, everything's where I expect it to be."

**Moderator:** Any challenges?

**P04:** "Not really. Maybe sometimes the photo quality isn't great if I'm in bad lighting, but I just retake it. Oh, and occasionally I'll accidentally submit something twice if my connection is spotty, but I can delete duplicates easily enough."

---

#### Interview P07 - Finance Director, Age 36
**Moderator:** As an approver, what's your experience reviewing expense reports?

**P07:** "I approve probably 60-80 reports a week. The mobile interface for approvals is garbage, honestly. The receipts are too small to read, so I always have to switch to desktop. I want to see the full receipt image, the amount, the business justification, and the requester's history all on one screen. Right now it's too many taps."

**Moderator:** What would make your job easier?

**P07:** "Batch approval would be huge. If I trust someone and their expenses are all under $100, just let me approve 10 at once. Also, flag anything unusual automatically—amounts over policy, duplicate submissions, weekend charges, that kind of thing."

---

#### Interview P09 - Product Manager, Age 33
**Moderator:** Describe your workflow when you're traveling for work.

**P09:** "I'm on the road a lot—probably 8-10 days a month. I submit everything in real-time now. Cab ride ends, I submit it before I get out. Dinner with a client, I submit it while waiting for the check. The app makes it frictionless. My only gripe is international currency conversion—it's not always accurate, and I have to manually adjust."

### 3. Support Ticket Excerpts (Last 90 Days, n=127 tickets)

**Ticket #4521 - Priority: Medium**

*User profile: 35-year-old finance analyst, mobile device: Samsung Galaxy S21*

*User profile: 41-year-old sales director, mobile device: iPhone 13*

**Ticket #4619 - Priority: Medium**  
"I can't figure out how to attach a receipt after I've already submitted an expense. The edit flow is confusing."

**Ticket #4701 - Priority: Low**  
"Love the app but the color contrast is hard to read in bright sunlight. I'm often outside at job sites and can barely see the screen."

### 4. Survey Open-Ended Responses (n=340 responses)

- "Dark mode for late-night submissions." (P/Engineering)

### 5. Ethnographic Observation Notes

**Observation Session with P02 (Sales Rep, Age 29)**  
*Conducted in coffee shop, 45-minute session*

- Participant pulled out phone between meetings to submit receipts
- Unlocked phone, opened FinFlowPro app with muscle memory (didn't search for it)
- Took photo of receipt on table—adjusted angle twice to reduce glare from overhead lights
- Spent ~8 seconds reviewing auto-populated fields, changed category from "Meals - General" to "Meals - Client Entertainment"
- Tapped submit, immediately closed app and returned to Slack
- Total time from unlock to submission: ~35 seconds
- **Notable:** Participant mentioned "I always do this right away because if I wait, I'll forget or lose the receipt"

**Observation Session with P11 (Regional Manager, Age 35)**  
*Conducted in participant's car during lunch break, 30-minute session*

- Participant was parked but noted they "usually try to submit while driving, but I know I shouldn't"
- Opened app, selected "New Expense" button
- Attempted to take photo of receipt but had difficulty holding both phone and receipt in cramped car environment
- Ended up placing receipt on dashboard and leaning forward to photograph it
- Noted frustration: "This would be so much easier if I could just describe it verbally and attach the photo later"
- Mentioned using voice-to-text for business justification field
- Total time: ~2 minutes due to physical logistics

## Synthesis Themes (from Research Team)

### Theme 1: Real-Time Submission is Preferred
Power users and frequent travelers submit expenses immediately after incurring them, rather than batching. This prevents lost receipts and reduces end-of-week administrative burden.

**Evidence:** P01, P04, P09 interviews; ethnographic session with P02

### Theme 2: OCR Accuracy is "Good Enough"
While OCR isn't perfect (85-90% accuracy reported), users don't view it as a major pain point. They expect to make minor corrections and do so quickly.

**Evidence:** P01 interview; survey responses

### Theme 3: Approvers Need Efficiency Tools
Managers approving high volumes of expenses want batch operations, better data visibility, and automatic flagging of policy violations.

**Evidence:** P07 interview; support tickets

### Theme 4: Category Selection is Tedious
The long dropdown list of expense categories slows down submission and leads to errors. Users want smart suggestions or search functionality.

**Evidence:** P01 interview; support ticket #4521; survey responses

### Theme 5: Mobile-First Users Expect Seamless Experience
The majority of submissions happen on mobile, and users expect fast, intuitive, crash-free experiences comparable to consumer apps.

**Evidence:** All interviews; support ticket #4556
